## Requirements
* Rooted Android device with Android 5.0 or higher and the language set to english.
* Pokémon Go installed.
## Setup
### Rooting
1. Ensure your phone has an unlocked bootloader and is able to support root. [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) is a good place to start for a custom ROM and they have good installation instruction for each device.
2. Install [Magisk](https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-magisk/) (v19.0 or older) to root the phone via recovery. Repackage the MagiskManager App and add Pokémon Go to Magisk Hide. Make sure to delete the folder `/sdcard/MagiskManager` after repackaging. It's necessary to pass the Safetynet check to run Pokémon Go on rooted phones. Check the Safetynet status in the MagiskManager App.
### APK
You can get the APK by directly downloading it from Github [here](https://github.com/pogo-account-checker/Pogo-Account-Checker/blob/master/apk/pogo-account-checker.apk), or by building it yourself. You will have to take some additional steps if you want to build the APK yourself:
1. Install the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
2. `git clone` and open the project in Android Studio.
3. The application uses the [ML Kit's text recognition APIs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/recognize-text). In order for the text recognition to work a `google-services.json` file must be downloaded and placed in the `app` folder. This file contains confidential information, hence it's not added to this repo. [Here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) is explained how to obtain this file.
4. Install the app on your phone by clicking the green play button in Android Studio.
## Checking accounts
First you have to put your PTC accounts in a `.txt` file, username and password should be seperated by a delimiter of choice. The delimiter can be chosen in the settings menu. Make sure to place each account on a new line. `.txt` file example:
```txt
username01,password01
username02,password02
```
Then transfer the file to your phone. Next open the app, press the `set accounts` button, grant root permission forever, and select the file. Press start to start checking the accounts. The checked accounts can be found in the `PogoAccountChecker` folder on your phone. In this folder you can find the following files:
* `not_banned.txt` - contains accounts that still work.
* `not_banned_L{lvl}.txt` - contains accounts with level `lvl` that still work. Check `Detect account level` in settings to enable level detection.
* `not_banned_tutorial.txt` - contains unbanned accounts that still need to complete the tutorial. Check `Check for tutorial` in settings for tutorial detection.
* `banned.txt` - contains accounts that are banned.
* `wrong_credentials.txt` - contains accounts that don't exist or have a wrong username/password.
* `new.txt` - contains accounts that have never been logged in to Pokémon Go.
* `not_activated.txt` - contains accounts that have not been activated via the activation email.
* `locked.txt` - contains accounts that are locked. Locked accounts can't be accessed untill their password gets changed.
* `error.txt` - contains accounts for which checking failed 10 times in a row, this can for example happen when there is no internet connection.
